  "supplement": "Your primary task is to help organize contigs into chromosome-level scaffolds. Focus on identifying which contigs belong to the same chromosome based on their interaction patterns.\n\nWorkflow:\n1. First, identify distinct chromosomal blocks along the diagonal — these appear as bright square regions with strong internal signal and weak signal between blocks\n2. For each identified chromosome, suggest creating a scaffold with a descriptive name\n3. Then assign contigs to their respective scaffolds using `scaffold paint`\n4. If contigs within a block are out of order, suggest `move` commands to correct the ordering before scaffolding\n\nNaming conventions:\n- Use `Chr1`, `Chr2`, etc. for numbered chromosomes (largest first)\n- Use `ChrZ`, `ChrW` for sex chromosomes if identifiable\n- Use `ChrUn` for unplaced contigs that don't clearly belong to any block\n\nFocus on the largest, most clearly defined blocks first. Leave ambiguous contigs unassigned rather than guessing.",
